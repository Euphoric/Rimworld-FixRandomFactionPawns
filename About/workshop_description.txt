[b]Fixes random pawns being generated in factions.[/b]

[h2]About[/h2]

When generating pawns of specific kind, Rimworld can select a random faction to put that pawn into. This can result in random colonists, villagers or refugees in groups from a faction. This is most noticeable when using Hospitality along with alien races faction, as it results in normal human pawns being part of visitor groups.

This mod changes that behavior so that only factions into which the pawn can belong to can be selected. So no longer you see villagers being part of Moyo visitors.

[h2]FAQ[/h2]

This mod can be added or removed in the middle of the game.
But it won't have much effect if added halfway as it won't change incorrect pawns already in faction.
It will only work if used from the very beginning of a game.
